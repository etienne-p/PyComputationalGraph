the granularity questions:
	how do we define operations? exp? sigmoid?
	any higher level op may be defined in terms of simpler ops
	there's a performance cost in implementing tons of lower level ops

naming: 
	you so far use 'input' a lot,
	except that when talking about graph input,
	you may want to talk about 'parameters' instead

grad check:
	you need a function Rn -> R,
	usually your cost function will return in range R,
	but any function whose range is in R will let you perform grad check on your computational graph
